let's create a python fastapi backend + tailwindcssv4 frontend.

for the backend, it needs to be able to serve videos and intract with a 'backend' which will be a json file.

for the frontend, we need a clean ui for video labelling. so what happens is that on a video, while it's playing or stationary, we should be able to highlight & label data and it will be saved by the backend the size, potisions, and stuff. for now, it should stay stationary throughout the video.

the style of the website should be 'canvasy' yet medical professional.
